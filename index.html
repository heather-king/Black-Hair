            <h3> Black Hair Roots</h3>
             <p>
                 In order to undertsand the significance of Black Hair in contemporary culture, one must first understand its historical importance. In many early African civilizations, hair was viewed as a status symbol, a marker of the tribe you belonged, or even as someone's family background. For example, in certain tribes, if men were preparing for war, they would sometimes wear their hair in a braided style. For women who were in mourning, they may have left their hair untouched, or prefered to wear it in a more subdued style.
             </p>
             
             <p>
                 Regardless of how their hair was worn, many believed that their hair was powerful. Because black hair tends to grow out towards the sky, as opposed to straight down, it was thought that black hair allowed for a closer connection to God.

           <h3> Civil Rights and Black Hair</h3>
           <p>
              Beginning in the 1960s, black hair began to take on a more important role in its relation to the Civil Right Movement. During this time, black people began to stand up for their rights and speak out against racism in their communities and within the institutions that they were a part of. As part of this resistance, many people began to grow out their "natural" hair as a means to push back against European beauty standards.  
              
           </p>
           
           <p> Black people began to view themselves as powerful and strong and therefore wanted their hair to be an extension of those same feelings. There was no hairstyle more important during this time than the Afro.</p>

           <h3> Black Hair in Contemporary Culture</h3>
           
           <p> Since the Civil Rights Movement to now, black hair has gone through another transformation. Beginning in the late 2000s, many women and men began to embrace their natural hair yet again. Called "the natural hair movement", many black women began to reject their learned habits of religiously chemically striaghtening their hair in an effort to embrace the hair that naturally grows from their head.  
               
              </p>
              
              <p> With the help of social media platforms such as Youtube and Tumblr, many black women began to share their natural hair journeys online. By recording progress videos, posting reviews on different styling products, and offering suggestions on way to style their hair, black women began to help forge a community of natural hair women from various countries and continents. </p>
